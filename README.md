# shredderpy

shredderpy will take an image, put it through a "shredder", then paste the strips back together. You just loose some strips along the way.


## Description

This is just a fun project I'm working on to create some weird image results. For now, the image is split into strips, then pasted back together. Every other strip is placed in a new image, with the end result leaving 4 different, but similar images.
